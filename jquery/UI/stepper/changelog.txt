== UI Stepper ChangeLog ==

== 0.0.5-alpha ==

* [21-Aug-08] Added support for numeric keypad

== 0.0.4-alpha ==

* [23-JUL-08] Fixed bug whereby manual input was not being recorded. If an
* illegal numeric value is entered the stepper will automatically default
* to the next step thereby preventing unwanted values. For example if step
* size is 10 and current value is 30. If changes value to 32 the stepper 
* will change it to 40 as that's the next logical value. 

== 0.0.3-alpha ==

* [22-JUL-08] Added a few more standard widget methods. Now uses bind rather 
* than the separate event  methods. Holding UP/DOWN cursor keys and +/- keys 
* makes the stepper spin continuously until it reaches the limit.

== 0.0.2-alpha ==

* [22-JUL-08] Added mousedown feature to spin buttons

== 0.0.1-alpha ==

* [21-JUL-08] First build
